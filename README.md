    This is a demonstration of the use of redacted access tokens combined with Okta as an Authorization server. It uses a Javascript application that is build on top of Apache Cordova, enabling the code to be compiled to both web as well as mobile (iOS tested).<br />
    <br />
    The concepts demonstrated are:
    <ul>
    	<li>Single code base for web and mobile (Apche Cordova)</li>
    	<li>Authentication with Okta via Authorization code flow with PKCE</li>
    	<li>Redacted access tokens to prevent PII spill and fraud</li>
    	<li>Seamless end user experience with everlasting refresh tokens</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <strong>NOTE: This is a demo, and the code is not tested nor written to be used in production!</strong>
